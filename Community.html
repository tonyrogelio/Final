        <h1>PaDagat: Panglimpyo sa Dagat</h1> <br>
        <p>The event, PaDagat: Panglimpyo sa Dagat, organized by DOST at Silliman University, was held on September 29, 2024, at 5:30 AM. We cleaned Silliman beach and Cheesestick country. We want to contribute to environmental conservation.<br/><br/>
            This activity taught me the value of environmental responibility and action. I was surprised at how many trash there were alongside the beach and the road. We were dedicated to pick up as many trash as we can.<br/><br/>
            This gave me experience and strength. This activity strengthened my resolve to reduce waste in our environment. Next time, I would invite more friends.<br/><br/>
            Because of this activity, I am more committed to protecting the environment. I am now more disciplined and careful where I throw my wastes. I now throw my wastes in their proper trash bins.</p>

        <h1>Project Painit</h1> <br>
        <p>On September 16, 2024, at 8:00 AM, Project Painit was organized by DOST at Silliman University. We gave out snacks and coffee to our dedicated personnel. We wanted to express gratitude for their hard work. This day had a very cold and harsh weather.<br/><br/>
            This activity emphasizes the value of showing appreciation. Appreciation for the efforts of our personnels. This gesture brings warmth to both us and the personnels.<br/><br/>
            This experience taught me the importance of expressing gratitude. Even though its a small act of gratitude, it still brings smiles to their faces.<br/><br/>
            Because of this activity, I am more mindful of the power of kindness and appreciation. I now want to share my blessings to the community. I appreciate every act of gratitude, and I will do what I can to share.</p>

        <h1>CALL FOR DONATIONS</h1> <br>
        <p> The Call for Donations by The Sillimanian Initiative took place on October 26, 2024, at 9:00 PM, in response to Tropical Storm Kristine's impact on the Bicol region.  I donated a small amount of money to support them. It was the only thing I could do as a college student.<br/><br/>
            This showed the importance of community support. During this time of crisis, support is very important. I want to help people that are affected in storms because I also had history with storms.<br/><br/>
            This made me understand the importance of disaster respons. We should be more prepared in case of crisis like this. I plan to keep on donating to the affected people.<br/><br/>
            Because of this activity, I am more committed to helping those in need during difficult times. I am more prepared for natural disasters. I want to provide immediate aid to the affected communities.</p>

        <p>On November 12, 2024, at 10:00 AM, we joined a feeding program organized by the Department of Agriculture - Central Visayas at Candau-ay Elementary School. We celebrated the national rice awareness month. We gave out food to the children and teachers.<br/><br/>
            This activity showed the importance of ensuring food security. We educated the kids about nutrition. This event was very fun because we played with the kids and we were in costumes, I was a big corn.<br/><br/>
            This showed the value of community outreach. It showed the importance of the role of agriculture in addressing hunger. I hope to keep on participating in the events of Department of Agriculture.<br/><br/>
            Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of promoting food security and healthy habits. I am thankful for the food my family has provided me all my life. I plan to provide food to the hungry.</p>

        <h1>Kadiwa</h1> <br>
        <p>The Kadiwa event, organized by the Department of Agriculture - Central Visayas, took place on November 11, 2024, at 1:00 PM near the port. We cleaned chairs and tables and arranged the rice for sale. For the arrangement of the tables and chairs, I was the one who set them up.<br/><br/>
            I saw the value of agriculture. It is very important to support local farmers with their rice. We are dedicated to selling rice at a cheaper price.<br/><br/>
            This activity has inspired me to support local farmers. I support the initiatives that promote sustainable agriculture. The activity was beneficial for the farmers.<br/><br/>
            Because of this activity, I am more supportive of local farmers and sustainable agricultural practices. I want to keep on doing this for cheaper rice. This motivated me to do more.</p>
