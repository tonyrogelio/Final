        <h1>Freshie Walk</h1> <br>
        <p>The Freshie Walk happened on August 16, 2024, at 1:00 PM. We started our march from Silliman Gym to the amphitheater, had a session for worship, and performed our cheer. My role was to march with the group and join in actively in cheering. This event was about inviting freshmen into the community at Silliman.<br/><br/>
            Through this activity, I got that sense of belongingness to the school. Everyone was so happy and they inspired me to be happy too. Our cheer was pretty good too.<br/><br/>
