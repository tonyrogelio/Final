        <h1>CCS Devotion Mass</h1> <br>
        <p>On august 19, 2024, at 8:00 AM , I attended a Devotion Mass at Silliman Church. The event had CCS students dedicating time for worship and spiritual reflection. My role was a participant, alongside the faculty and students.</p>
        <br/><p>I gained a deeper appreciaton for faith and personal growth. The experience reminded me to pause and reflect despite how busy life is. I am a Bosconian and I was glad that we had a mass.</p>
        <br/><p>This experience shows the importance of balancing academics and spiritual well-being. I learned that reflecting enhances personal growth. I plan to attend more events like this to stay connected with the Lord.</p>
        <br/><p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the importance of my spiritual health. I am inspired to seek balance. This event reminded me of my highschool days because of the mass and I would love to stay engaged in meaningful activities.</p>

        <p>On august 31, 2024, at 6:00 PM, I participated in J2Mad Praise and worship team anniversary concert. The event celebrated with music at Silliman church. I have to be honest, it was very inspiring to start college with religious programs such as this event. </p>
        <br/><p>I now have a sense of appreciation for how music connects to our spirits. As i said, It was very inspiring. I witnessed joy and unity among the participants.</p>
        <br/><p>This event taught me the power of worship. I plan to stay involved in religious activities such as this because somehow it gives me hope that everything would be okay. I am given faith by these kinds of activities.</p>
        <br/><p>Because of this activity, I am more inspired to seek spiritual growth and share among my friends. Every time I attend activities like this, I am reminded of the importance of faith and unity. This event strengthened my bond with the lord</p>

        <h1>Acoustic Night</h1> <br>
        <p>On september  17, 2024, at 6:00 PM, I attended an event named acoustic night held at the Catacombs. The event had an open mic, anyone could sing. The pastors sang most of the time. We had games such as sharing favorite shows and enacting our favorite scenes.</p>
        <br/><p>I will never regret joining this event. Because this event brought random people together through music and games. I came in with 5 friends and went out with 20! It was a warm event with worship songs that lasted an impression on all of us.</p>
        <br/><p>This event showed the importance of building bonds. I learned that creativity can uplift others. I would love to sing on the mic but I have a really bad voice. I would love to join this event next year!</p>
        <br/><p>Because of this activity, I am more open to participating to christian events. I am inspired to seek joy in every moment. I am also inspired to bake cookies because they had the best cookies there.</p>

        <h1>Kinaiya sa Pagpasaylo</h1> <br>
        <p>On september 4, 2024, at 6:30 PM, I attended “Kinaiya sa Pagpasaylo.” We shared our sins and hardships in an open forum, creating an athmosphere of healing. The objective was to give forgiveness and understanding through sharing.</p>
        <br/><p>This activity helped me to realize the power of healing in communication. Everyone was honest here and I was silent because I was nervous. It was very nice to see how everyone supporte eachother.</p>
        <br/><p>This event showed me the value of forgiveness and how it heals a person. I learned that opennes is good sometimes. I would encourage more people to join an event like this.</p>
        <br/><p>Because of this activity, I am more understanding of the importance of forgiveness. I will now have an open heart. I will not be afraid to share my feelings, sins and hardships next time.</p>

        <h1>Living Rosary</h1> <br>
        <p>On october 31, 2024, at 6:00 PM, I participated in a living rosary at casa miani. We walked around the barangay while reciting the rosary, then returned to the orphanage to continue praying. I was really nervous because I had to recite one part of the rosary in front.</p>
        <br/><p>This activity made me understand the power of prayer. The orphans along with some sillimanians were very united during this event. Everyone was very sincere, there were no jokes, everyone was praying.</p>
        <br/><p>I am reminded of the importance of community in improving your spiritual life. I learned that praying makes the orphans in casa miani happy and I am touched by this. I would love to be friends with the orphans.</p>
        <br/><p>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the values of casa miani. They are very devoted to prayer there. I would love to reflect on life with them.</p>

        <h1>Sunday Mass</h1> <br>
        <p>On October 13, 2024, at 6:00 PM, I attended Sunday mass at Our Mother of Perpetual Help Redemptorist Church. The talk was about hope, providing guidance to us. I participated and sang the songs.<br/><br/>
            The mass deepened my understanding of maintaining hope and faith. The church played songs that I was familiar with so I got to sing whole heartedly. The church always has a sense of peace and optimism.<br/><br/>
            This event has made me stay hopeful and trust in the Lords plans. Although life is uncertain, all will be okay in time. I plan to attend mass regularly.<br/><br/>
            Because of this activity, I am more inspired to face challenges. I am now motivated to join sunday mass every week. I am encouraged to trust in the power of prayer.</p>

            <h1>The Book of James</h1> <br>
            <p> On october 2, 2024, at 6:00 PM, I participated in a bible study. The topic was about the book of James. The session focused on emphasizing faith and works.<br/><br/>
                This bible study improved my understanding of living out my faith through actions. The group was very interactive and we also played games. I appreciated the open discussions through open forum.<br/><br/>
                This event has made me reflect on my actions and how they align with my beliefs. I have learned to balance my faith and deeds, that I can apply on my daily life. I would love to go to a bible study again, and I would prepare questions beforehand.<br/><br/>

                <p> On november 19, 2024, at 5:00 PM, I attended the Galilean Fellowship, a required event for CCS students with CHS1. Because of the rain, the event was held in a classroom in Ausejo Hall. The session focused on faith over fear and the story of David and Goliath. We also role played the story of David and Goliath.<br/><br/>
                    The fellowship made me see the importance of faith when facing our life giants. Our facilitator talked about his life and the challenges he went through as a college student. He inspired a lot of us that night.<br/><br/>
                    I am now powered to face my fears with faith and trust in the Lords guidance. I learend that even small acts of faith can lead to victories. A very fun and amazing event!<br/><br/>
